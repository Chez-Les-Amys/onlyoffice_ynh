OnlyOffice Document Server is an online office suite comprising viewers and editors for texts, spreadsheets and presentations, fully compatible with Office Open XML formats: .docx, .xlsx, .pptx and enabling collaborative editing in real time.

Online collaborative edition of OnlyOffice documents requires: 
1. a server part, with two installation options:
   1. OnlyOffice Document Server packaged for YunoHost. 
   2. The [Community Document Server for Nextcloud](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/documentserver_community) 

2. a client part, such as: 
   1. The [ONLYOFFICE connector for Nextcloud](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/onlyoffice) 
   2. The [ONLYOFFICE Desktop Editors](https://www.onlyoffice.com/fr/download-desktop.aspx)

The Nextcloud addicts may follow [this tutorial](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/nextcloud_ynh#configure-onlyoffice-integration) to install (1.ii) and (2.i) on one Nextcloud instance. However, performance and architecture are limited.
